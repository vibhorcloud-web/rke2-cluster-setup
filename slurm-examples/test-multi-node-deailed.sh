# In Slurm, we must route our commands through Kubernetes to the controller pod.

# --- SBATCH DIRECTIVES (The Resource Request) ---
# These #SBATCH comments are read by the Slurm scheduler before execution.
# They define the exact hardware slice we are requesting from the NodeSet.

#SBATCH --job-name=slurm-mpi-sim
# Request exactly 2 compute nodes (which maps to your 2 Slurm worker pods).
#SBATCH --nodes=2
# Request a total of 4 tasks (processes) for this job.
#SBATCH --ntasks=4
# Force Slurm to distribute the 4 tasks evenly: 2 tasks on node 0, 2 tasks on node 1.
#SBATCH --tasks-per-node=2
# Define where the standard output and error files should be written.
# Note: In our current setup, this writes to the local /tmp of the execution pod.
#SBATCH --output=/tmp/multi-node-%j.out
#SBATCH --error=/tmp/multi-node-%j.err

# --- EXECUTION BLOCK ---
# This part runs exactly ONCE on the primary allocated node (e.g., slurm-0).
